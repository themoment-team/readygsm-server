description: Reply to resolved PR inline comments with commit hash
---

## Context

- Run data collection: !`bash scripts/dev/get-pr-data.sh`
- PR inline comments: Read `.pr-tmp/pr_comments.json`
- Changed files: Read `.pr-tmp/pr_changed_files.txt`
- Commits in this PR: Read `.pr-tmp/pr_commits.txt`
- Full diff: Read `.pr-tmp/pr_diff.txt`
- Repo name: !`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`
- PR number: !`gh pr view --json number -q .number`

## Your Task

For each comment in `.pr-tmp/pr_comments.json`:

**Step 1 – Judge if resolved**
Compare `path` + `body` of the comment against the diff in `.pr-tmp/pr_diff.txt`.
- RESOLVED: The diff contains a change in the same file that directly addresses the comment's concern
- UNRESOLVED: No relevant change found for that file/concern

**Step 2 – Select commit hash (for resolved comments)**
Run: `git log origin/<base>..HEAD --follow --pretty="%H %h %s" -- "<path>"`
Select the short hash (7 chars) of the most relevant commit.

**Step 3 – Post reply (for each resolved comment)**
Always quote variables to prevent shell injection. `path` and `comment_id` come from external PR data and may contain special characters.
```
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr_number>/comments/<comment_id>/replies" \
  -f body="<short_hash> 에서 해결했습니다."
```

**Step 4 – Final report**
```
## 답변 완료 코멘트
- [file:line] "comment excerpt" → {hash} 해결했습니다.
...

## 미해결 코멘트 (reply 없음)
- [file:line] "comment excerpt" → 사유: ...
...
```

**Step 5 – Cleanup**
Remove temporary files created by the data collection script:
```
rm -rf .pr-tmp
```
